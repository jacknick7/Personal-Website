                            The increase in the computing capacity of graphics cards and the emergence of virtual reality headsets
                            at relatively affordable prices in recent years has allowed the development and expansion of interactive
                            exploration of volumetric models in an immersive virtual reality environment.<br /><br />
                            Volume models, which are currently used in various fields such as medicine or industrial design, has
                            certain problems. One of the most important is how to move from the input values of the model to the
                            graphical representation that we see and how we can modify this representation interactively. For establishing
                            this correspondence, what is known as a transfer function is used, which in its most basic way relates the
                            input value to an opacity and a color. These types of transfer functions work well if they are defined
                            before the user explores the model in real-time, but their interactive modification during exploration is quite
                            cumbersome.

                            The videos below give a glimpse at the developed metaphors, the interactions and the volume rendering using
                            <i>style transfer functions</i>. Please note that the demonstrations were recorded using a simulator (the project
                            was designed with VR in mind, but due to COVID-19 I didn’t have access to the VR system when I recorded the
                            videos) and interactions may seem rougher than they really are.

                            I’d like to take advantage of this little corner to talk about some video games that are very dear to me. I
                            love games like Shadow of the Colossus or Silent Hill 2, but I feel like the following 3 games changed me in
                            meaningful ways:

                        <h4>Mass Effect (BioWare, 2007)</h4>

                        <p class="entry-p">
                            Mass Effect was the reason I bought a 360. It was also the game that made me realize that I wanted to know how
                            video games were made. To this day, I'm still amazed at the ability of the original Mass Effect to make its
                            universe seem bigger than it actually is, the writing and some clever design decisions do wonders for the game.
                            Talking to the Sovereign for the first time is still as powerful a moment as it was in 2007.

                        <h4>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (Kojima Productions, 2001)</h4>
                        <p class="entry-p">
                            The first time I played Sons of Liberty I remember feeling like I was missing a lot. I came back years later
                            just to realize how thematically advanced this game was for its time. Sons of Liberty is a work about memes,
                            video games and the relation between player and creator. I could be hours talking about Hideo Kojima’s best game
                            but I doubt I can compete with George Weidman’s terrific <i>Critical Close-up</i>:

                        <h4>NIER (Cavia Inc., 2010)</h4>
                        <p class="entry-p">
                            I played NIER for the first time in 2014 and since then I’ve been thinking about it from time to time. What
                            Yoko Taro (and many others like the dev team at Cavia or writer Sawako Natori) achieved with this game shows
                            that videogames still have a long way to go before we reach the limits of its expressiveness. I’m glad that
                            with the recently updated version more people have been able to play this monumental work.
